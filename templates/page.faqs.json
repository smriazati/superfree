Super luxurious and intentional, through and through. <\/p><p><strong>How long does it last?<\/strong><\/p><p>The shelf life of maca maca is 4-6 months unopened and unrefrigerated (stored in a cool, dry, shaded place). Just put it in the fridge after opening and it’ll last just as long, or keep at room temp and finish within 3 months! Other products vary, (link product descriptions), but given the right storage you’re able to stock up on all of our goods – the point is to have these supportive foods readily and consistently available for your daily life!<\/p><p><\/p>"
